GitHub rejected committing a file larger than 100MB, so the JAR file is in my Dropbox:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/gxwe52m9yviae4k/TrajectoryMining-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar?dl=0

This was the message I used:
Adding JAR file from TrajectoryMining project. It can be called (using the DAT file provided in that project) as follows:
java -cp TrajectoryMining-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar single.MainApp 20 2 2 10 3 100 1000 dis_flated_sampled.dat
Parameters are named (not explained in any way) when using the JAR but some of them are missing
